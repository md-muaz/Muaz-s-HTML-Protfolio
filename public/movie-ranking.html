<h3>Inception</h3>
<p><h4>This is a sci-fi movie. The plot is written on dream and sub-consious mind. It is also a top pick because it's a Nonal movie.</h4></p>

<h3>Pirates Of the Caribbean</h3>
<p><h4>This is a movie of fantasy genre. But the plot of the movie is simply amazing. Jhonny Deep AKA Captain Jack Sparrow added his acting to make this film series the best! </h4></p>

<h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
<p><h4>This is a movie of spy genre which is one of my most favourite! This film series is an absolute gem in spy genre. And actop Tom cruise acted so top-notch that it has become one of a kind. </h4></p>
